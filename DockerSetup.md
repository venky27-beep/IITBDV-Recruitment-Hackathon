## Prerequisites

### What is Docker?

**Docker** is a containerization platform that packages applications and all their dependencies into isolated, portable containers. Think of it as a lightweight virtual machine that ensures software runs identically across any system — whether it's Windows, Linux, or macOS.

**Note**: You don't need to understand Docker in detail to follow this guide. Simply treat it as a tool that makes the ROS 2 + RViz2 simulation environment work seamlessly on your system.

### System Requirements

- **Windows**: Windows 10 (Build 19041+) or Windows 11 with admin privileges
- **Linux**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later
- **RAM**: Minimum 4GB (8GB+ recommended)
- **Disk Space**: At least 10GB free space
- **Internet**: Active internet connection for downloading Docker images

---

## Windows Setup

> **Linux users:** Skip this entire section. Jump straight to [Linux / WSL Setup](#linux--wsl-setup) → Step 6.

### Step 1: Install Docker Desktop for Windows

#### 1.1 Download Docker Desktop

1. Navigate to the official Docker installation page:
   ```
   https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/
   ```

2. You should see a page similar to this:

   ![Docker Download Page](images/image1.jpeg)

3. Click on **"Docker Desktop for Windows - x86_64"** to download the installer.

4. Wait for the download to complete.

#### 1.2 Install Docker Desktop

1. Locate the downloaded `Docker Desktop Installer.exe` file and double-click to run it.

2. The installation wizard will start. Keep all **default options** selected throughout the installation process.

3. When prompted to install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), **allow all incoming requests** and proceed with the installation. Docker will automatically configure WSL for you.

4. Once installation is complete, your screen should look similar to this:

   ![Docker Desktop Application](images/image2.jpeg)

5. Docker Desktop is now installed and running on your system.

### Step 2: Verify Docker Installation

#### 2.1 Check Docker is Running

1. Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** as Administrator.

2. Type the following command to check your WSL installation:
   ```powershell
   wsl -l -v
   ```

3. You should see output similar to this:

   ![WSL List Verification](images/image3.jpeg)

4. **Verify**: Look for an entry labeled `docker-desktop` in the output. If present, Docker is successfully installed and WSL is properly configured.

### Step 3: Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with Ubuntu 22.04

#### 3.1 What is WSL?

**Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** is a compatibility layer that allows you to run Linux distributions natively on Windows. It provides a Linux kernel and environment without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine.

**Why do we need WSL?**
- The ROS 2 simulation environment is Linux-based; WSL brings Linux to Windows
- Provides better performance than traditional virtual machines
- Seamless integration with Windows and Docker

#### 3.2 Install Ubuntu 22.04

1. Open **PowerShell** as Administrator.

2. Type the following command:
   ```powershell
   wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04
   ```

3. The system will begin downloading and installing Ubuntu 22.04. This may take several minutes.

4. Once complete, you'll be prompted to create a username and password. **Set these credentials** — you'll use them to log into your Linux environment.

5. After setup, your terminal should display your Linux username and you'll be logged into the Ubuntu environment:

   ![WSL Terminal Login](images/image4.jpeg)

#### 3.3 Accessing WSL Anytime

To access your WSL environment from Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt at any time, simply type:
```powershell
wsl
```

---

## Linux / WSL Setup

### Step 4: Configure Docker Desktop for WSL Integration

> **Linux users (not using WSL):** If you installed Docker Engine directly on Linux, skip Steps 4 and 5 and go to [Step 6](#step-6-clone-repository-and-build-container).

#### 4.1 Open Docker Settings

1. Open the **Docker Desktop** application.

2. Click on the **Settings** icon (gear icon) in the top-right corner:

   ![Docker Settings](images/image5.jpeg)

#### 4.2 Enable WSL Integration

1. In the Settings menu, navigate to **Resources** → **WSL Integration**.

2. You should see a screen similar to this:

   ![WSL Integration Settings](images/image6.jpeg)

3. **Enable** the toggle for `Ubuntu-22.04`.

4. Click **Apply and Restart** to apply the changes and restart the Docker daemon.

5. Wait for Docker to fully restart (this may take a few minutes).

### Step 5: Verify Docker in WSL

#### 5.1 Access WSL and Test Docker

1. Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt**.

2. Type the following command to enter your WSL Ubuntu environment:
   ```powershell
   wsl
   ```

3. Once inside the Linux environment, type:
   ```bash
   docker
   ```

4. If Docker is properly set up, you'll see Docker's help output. If you see an error, wait a moment for Docker to fully initialize and try again.

### Step 6: Clone Repository and Build Container

#### 6.1 Create a Working Directory

Inside your WSL / Linux environment, create a directory for your project:
```bash
mkdir ~/workspace
cd ~/workspace
```

#### 6.2 Clone the Repository

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/purvanyaTyagi/Simulation-Development-Recruitment-Hackathon .
```

#### 6.3 Build and Start the Container

From the repository root directory, build and start the Docker container:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

Or do both in one step:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will:
- Download the necessary Docker images (first time only)
- Build the container with all ROS 2 dependencies installed
- Start the container

The build process may take **10–15 minutes** depending on your internet speed and system performance.

#### 6.4 Verify Successful Build

Once the container is built and running, you should see output similar to this:

   ![Docker Compose Successful Build](images/image7.jpeg)

The container is now running in the background, and you can open a new terminal to interact with it.

## Running the Simulation

### Step 7: Access the Running Container and Launch RViz2

#### 7.1 Open a New Terminal

Open a **new terminal window** (keep the previous one running the Docker container).

#### 7.2 Enter the Docker Container

Type the following command to access the running container:
```bash
docker exec -it ros2-humble-ignition bash
```

This command:
- `docker exec`: Executes a command in a running container
- `-it`: Allows interactive terminal access
- `ros2-humble-ignition`: The name of your running container
- `bash`: Opens a bash shell inside the container

You'll now be inside the Docker container with access to the full ROS 2 environment.

#### 7.3 Launch the Simulation

Inside the container, type:
```bash
ros2 launch robot_sim sim.launch.py
```

**RViz2 should now launch on your screen!** You'll see the robot visualiser with your robot model rendered based on your URDF file and moving according to the logic in `trajectory.cpp`.

## Troubleshooting

### Docker-Related Issues

**Problem**: Docker command not found in WSL
- **Solution**: Ensure Docker Desktop is running on Windows and WSL integration is enabled in Settings → Resources → WSL Integration

**Problem**: Container fails to start
- **Solution**:
  1. Check Docker Desktop logs (Settings → Troubleshoot)
  2. Ensure sufficient disk space (at least 10GB free)
  3. Restart Docker Desktop

**Problem**: Out of memory errors
- **Solution**: Increase Docker's memory allocation in Settings → Resources → Memory (set to at least 4GB)

### WSL-Related Issues

**Problem**: WSL command not found
- **Solution**: Ensure Windows 10 (Build 19041+) or Windows 11. Update Windows if necessary.

**Problem**: Cannot enter WSL environment
- **Solution**:
  1. Run PowerShell as Administrator
  2. Check WSL status: `wsl --status`
  3. Reinstall if necessary: `wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04`

### RViz2 / Simulation Issues

**Problem**: RViz2 doesn't launch or appears blank
- **Solution**:
  1. Ensure you're inside the Docker container (verify with `whoami` command)
  2. Check graphics drivers are up to date on your host system
  3. Try setting the display: `export DISPLAY=:0` inside the container, then relaunch

**Problem**: Performance is slow
- **Solution**:
  1. Increase Docker's CPU allocation
  2. Close unnecessary applications on your host machine
  3. Reduce the complexity of your URDF model if needed
